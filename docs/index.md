# ArchitectOS Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **ArchitectOS (AOS)** — an AI-native build and refactor operating system.

## What is AOS?

ArchitectOS introduces a supervised interface between AI systems and real-world software using:

- declarative manifests  
- deterministic sandboxes  
- controlled directive language  
- reproducible validation flows  

---

## Core Documents

- [Whitepaper](../WHITEPAPER-ArchitectOS.md)  
- Manifest Schema (coming soon)  
- Directive Reference (coming soon)  

---

## Quick Start

Documentation will expand as AOS approaches v0.1.
